# Hi! I'm Alex!

I'm a software engineer and all-around millennial from the Mitten, currently in Seattle.

Right now, I'm working at [Google](https://www.google.com) working on BigQuery!

Before that, I was building declarative tools and code generators over at
[Google](https://www.google.com), data pipelines at
[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com) and Insurance software at [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com).

Before Palantir, I was at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) (Go Blue!).

You can find me spewing nonsense over on the bird app [@rambleraptor](https://www.twitter.com/rambleraptor) and over on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rambleraptor). Or you can always [email me](mailto:astephen2@gmail.com).
